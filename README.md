# COMP5118-Predicting-Football-Results
The aim of this project is to maximize the utility of already processed data and incorporate into a machine learning model. 
For this, I plan to use FIFA ratings of players, referees and the existing football datasets. 
Using original FIFA ratings gives an overview of how good or bad a player is. 
I plan to build a classifier model that will predict the result of the game. 
Based on the data available, we can try to predict the outcome of the game. 
This article presents the required information for proposal of the project, like, related work and how the approach will be taken.

How to Setup the project?
  1. I have used Pycharm community edition for the purpose of this project. In order to recreate this work, it would be helpful if you had an IDE of similar sorts. 
  2. Using git: 'git clone https://github.com/PSatyadevAbhiram/COMP5118-Predicting-Football-Results.git'
  3. Normal download: Download the zip file by clicking on the code button. 
  4. Extract the file in your system and setup in an IDE of your choice (PyCharm is preferred)
  5. After setting up, go to the Testing/testing.py and run that particular file. 
  6. Once the process is complete, you will find the saved models, and the required graphs to showcase the results. 
  7. The code will also create a text file consisting the results of the project in the following order; 
    a) Logistic Regression model accuracy
    b) SVM model accuracy.
    c) Decision Tree model accuracy.
    d) XgBoost accuracy.
    e) Logistic Regression F1 score.
    f) SVM model F1 score.
    g) Decision tree model F1 score.
    g) XgBoost F1 score.
    h) Logistic regression Confusion matrix.
    i) SVM Model confusion matrix.
    j) Decision Tree confusion matrix.
    h) XgBoost confusion matrix. 
I apologize for not following the conventional spaces in the text file. They will need to be applied. 

Thank You.
