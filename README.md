The aim of this paper is to maximize the utility of already processed data and incorporate into a machine learning model. For this, I plan to use FIFA ratings of players, referees and the existing football datasets. Using original FIFA ratings gives an overview of how good or bad a player is. I plan to build a classifier model that will predict the result of the game. Based on the data available, we can try to predict the outcome of the game. This article presents the required information for proposal of the project, like, related work and how the approach will be taken.
